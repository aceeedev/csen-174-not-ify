# Bop Swap Frontend!

## Setup

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js v22.20.0 LTS](https://nodejs.org/en)

Once you have Node, clone the repo to your computer. Then run the following command: `npm install`. Make sure you are in the `frontend` directory!

## Usage

Cool, now you can run the website in "developer mode" using the command: `npm run dev -- --host`. This will also expose the website to the local network.

Now you can visit the website by going to [http://127.0.0.1:5173](http://127.0.0.1:5173) or the URL in the terminal!
